# Chameleon
A fast, reliable, free, and open-source palette swapper for GameMaker Studio 2.

This project is newly released as of 7/10/2022. The shader itself should be rock solid but the editor may have some faults still. I'm definitely not going to claim it's well-organized internally :)

## Usage and demo

[Check out the wiki](// TODO: Actually link!) for usage and implementation details.

[Check out the latest release](https://github.com/Lojemiru/Chameleon/releases/latest) for both the palette construction tool, which also serves as a great way to try out the palette swapper.

## Todo
Want to help out? Here's what I'm aiming to do next with this tool:

- Backport shader and associated scripts to GameMaker: Studio 1.4.
- Add imagery to documentation.
- Add some form of safety check/warning on palette overlaps during compression.

I've also received a great deal of general GML education pertinent to this tool from the [GameMaker Kitchen Discord server](https://discord.gg/8krYCqr), particularly in regard to stuffing surfaces into buffers.
